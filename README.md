# Visualization of Live Data

This is a project to visualize live data. WindDirection is used to visualize the direction of the wind that is blowing in the following cities worldwide:
['ROC', 'LA', 'NYC', 'Paris', 'HK', 'NOLA', 'SF','MAN', 'LON', 'KAN', 'TYO', 'BOS', 'AUS', 'CHI', 'SEA', 'HOU', 'MIA', 'DET'].
WeatherData is used to visualize the temperature and humidity variations of different cities around the world. The bigger the circle, more is the temperature.

## Motivation

The project was made to learn how to turn realtime raw data and represent it visually to make it more unde and live data.

## Getting Started

Download the file and just run it in the browser. You should be fine.

### Prerequisites

Files you will need to get this to work:

1. P5.js
2. P5.dom.js

### Installing

Clone or download the repository and and just open the files - "windDirection.html" and "weatherData.html" in the browser. Keep these two files along with the folder p5 and it will work.

## Running the tests

Open "windDirection.html" and "weatherData.html" files in the browser and if it displays the visualization you are fine otherwise, inspect element to see if the p5.js and p5.dom.js files are added in the html file and also the p5 folder is present.

## Deployment

No additional requirements are necessary. Just open the files "windDirection.html" and "weatherData.html" in your browser.
